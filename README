steal time measures how much the underlying hardware is overcommitted: 
do a test with cpu hungry task, like compilation, while monitoring steal time.

performance should be measured in real time! -> how can we show that in a virtual internet? Well, steal time indicated how many percent of the cpu is unavailable to you. It can only be measured well by generating a cpu consuming task...

-> experiment: ruby 1.9.3 compilen op vms in gogrid, ninefold, amazon en brightbox,
elke seconde meten: steal time, cpu user, cpu system, cpu total, load

README:

If authentication fails over https links, make sure that curl-ca-bundle.crt can be found. Otherwise, net/https will silently ignore the http request.

All regions should contain at least one image that starts with "vi "

need Nginx as a ssl proxy

-------------

Implementation issue:
- subscribing to the feed of network elements and reporting that in the
  on-demand network feed
- share javascript code base (creating links / network elements / netapps)
- instructions to create an ssl proxy
- run standalone as well as in a PaaS service: Heroku / Google Appengine
